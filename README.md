# FoodTracker.ios
A tutorial of using swift to build an iOS application. Followed the tutorial step by step and tried to understand the whole procedure.
It will be really helpful to our project, Smart Wardrobe. Because one of the main features of its is to let users create an inventory of their clothes items. There are some similarities between this FoodTracker App and the Smart Wardrobe App we want to bulid.
